in order to compile .py file
	go to the folder where .py file is saved e.g. "d:\\work" and give following command

python -m First.py

after this you will get to see "__pycache__" folder inside the current working folder (d:\\work).

inside this "__pycache__" folder you will get
	"First.cpython-310.pyc" file



how to run .pyc file?


D:\work\__pycache__>python First.cpython-310.pyc

A .pyc file is a compiled Python file. When Python source code (.py files) is executed, the Python interpreter compiles it into an intermediate bytecode format. This bytecode is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the source code.

The bytecode is then stored in a file with a .pyc extension. The purpose of the .pyc file is to save the compiled bytecode so that it can be used for faster execution in subsequent runs of the Python script. This process is a form of optimization known as bytecode compilation.
