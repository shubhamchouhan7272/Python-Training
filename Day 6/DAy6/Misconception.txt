import First
	vs
from First import disp1

you get some performance advantage with the second statement. This is not correct. In either case python will compile and execute the entire module.
The only advantage you get with the second statement is that you can access disp1() function directly. E.g.

	disp1()

and with the first statement you must say:
First.disp1()
