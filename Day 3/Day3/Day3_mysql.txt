** NULL ==> means value not yet defined. NULL doesn't mean blank or 0.

-- is used for single line comment in mysql

/* multi
line  comments
*/

get specific columns and all rows ==> select c1,c2 from t1;

==> get specific rows ==> use where clause ==> select * from t1 where c1 = 1;

-- below command search for the data where the value of c2 is 'a' 
	select * from t1 where c2 = 'a';

--below command search for the data where the value of c2 is 'aaa'
	select * from t1 where c2 = 'aaa';

--below command search for the data where the value of c2 is b and c1=2
	select * from t1 where c2 = 'b' and c1 = 2;

--below command search for the data where the value of c2 is b or c1=2
	select * from t1 where c2 = 'b' or c1 = 2;

--below command search for the data where the value of c2 is b or c1=1
	select * from t1 where c2 = 'b' or c1 = 1;



-- not equal to operator using !=
select * from t1 where c1 != 1;



-- not equal to operator using <>  same as above !=
select * from t1 where c1 <> 1;

 
--greater than operator
	select * from t1 where c1 > 1;

-- In operator: ==> you can provide list of values that you want to search
	with equal to you can provide only one value but with In operator you can
provide a list of value.
	select * from t1 where c1 in (1,4,5);
	select * from t1 where c2 in ('a','b');


-- not in : ==> you can provide list of values that should not come in search

	select * from t1 where c1 not in (1,4,5);

--between operator is used to get a range of values,  between inclued boundaries values.
	select * from t1 where c1 between 2 and 5;
	select * from t1 where c2 between 'a' and 'c';
 
-- not between operator is excluding a specific range
	select * from t1 where c1 not between 2 and 5;
	select * from t1 where c2 not between 'a' and 'c';	

--is null operator is used to search rows where a specific column has null values
	select * from t1 where c3 is null;

--is not null operator is used to search rows where a specific column has no null values
	select * from t1 where c3 is not null;

insert into t1 values(11,'adffeaaz',current_date());

insert into t1 values(12,'addffeaaz',current_date());

insert into t1 values(13,'adffeeaaz',current_date());

insert into t1 values(14,'adffeaazz',current_date());


--like operator is used to search values based on a pattern
--two ways to do search using like operator :
-- % means any number of characters
-- _ means exactly 1 character

--below query search for c2 where c2 starts with character 'a'
	 select * from t1 where c2 like 'a%';

--below query search for c2 where c2 contains character 'a' anywhere
	select * from t1 where c2 like '%a%';

--below query search for c2 where c2 starts with 'a' and ends with 'z'
	select * from t1 where c2 like 'a%z';

--below query search for c2 where c2 starts with a and ends with 0 and should have exactly 3 characters
	select * from t1 where c2 like 'a_0';
